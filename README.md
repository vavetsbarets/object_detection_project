# Object detection project

This is the file with the completed project of the Deep Learning 1st semester course (Autumn, 2021) created by Deep Learning School of Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. 
The main idea of the project is the backbone (using PyTorch) creation of the SSD300 architecture which is used to detect objects. 
This architecture was used later on to detect fruits on the images. 

# Information about Deep Learning course: 

The 'Deep Learning' topics were covered using PyTorch library and the following topics were studied: 
1. ML refresher: sklearn, different models and their compositions, ML-modeling in Kaggle competitions
2. Intro to Neural Networks and Pytorch. 
3. Convolutional Neural Networks
4. Advanced training of Neural Networks and Image Classification
5. Semantic segmentation
6. Object detection
7. Generative models and autoencoders
8. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
